Unit 2: 

1. Both Object and String classes belong to which package
    java.lang
    java.base
    java.util
    lang
2. All the classes in java are subclass of Object class
3. Following code segments are effectively same.
    public class Test {}
    public class Test extends Object {}
4. Object is super class of all the classes in java 
5. java.lang package is automatically imported in any and all java program
6. When printing an object, which method of Object class is invoked?
7. toString method of Object class should be overridden in a class to print human readable representation of an object 
8. toString method returns string representation of an object.
9. If toString method is not overwridden in subclass, super class's toString method is called to return string represendation of the object.
10. What is the output of the following code?
class Test {
    public String toString() {
        return "Test";
    }
}
public class Test1 extends Test {

        Test1 t1 = new Test1();
        System.out.println(t1.toString());
    }
}
11. Which method of Object class is used to compare 2 objects? ____________
12. A string literal is enclosed in double quotes
13. Create java statement to declare a variable to store a string and initialize the string with the word 'my first string'. 
    Then write java code to print the string value to console.
14. A java string can be created using string literal or using constructor of java.lang.String class.

String s1 = "I am a string object";
int i = s1.indexOf("a", s1.indexOf("A")); 
    1) 2
    2) 3
    3) will result in StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
37. The following code will print an empty string irrespective of value of s. (true)
String s = "SOME RANDOM STRING";
System.out.println(s.substring(s.length()));
38. Implement a code snippet such that each character in string s is printed in a new line in console
String s = "some random string";
for (/* implement this */) {
    System.out.println(/* implement this */);
}
39. equals is a method in java.lang.Object class and is used to compare 2 objects.
40. String class overrides equals method defined in Object class to provide specific implementation to compare 2 strings.

"short".compareTo("Short");
"short".compareTo("sHort");
"short".compareTo("shOrt");
"short".compareTo("shorT");

46. What does immutable property of String mean? Please explain with examples.
47. Analyze the following 2 statements and explain the difference with code samples (if needed)
a) String s1 = "a string";
b) String s1 = new String("a string");
48. What is the value of s1 in below code
String s1 = "I am a string object";
s1 += Boolean.FALSE;
        1) compile error
        2) "I am a string objectfalse"
        3) "I am a string object false"
49. What are the rules for lexicographic ordering for alpha-numeric characters
50. Explain the difference between lexicographical and numerical ordering with examples.
51. If s1 comes before s2 when arranged in alphabetical order, s1.compareTo(s2) will return a value (True)

All uppercase letters come before lower case letters. 
If two letters are the same case, then alphabetic order is used to compare them. 
If two strings contain the same characters in the same positions, then the shortest string comes first.

String methods in APCS:
length
substring
indexOf
equals
compareTo






Assignment 1: 
Just as we have worked with the Course class, we will now create our own Polygon class. 
The polygon class should have at least 1 instance variable which will be an int named numSides. 
The class should also have overloaded constructors with one having 0 parameters and the other having 
1. There should also be a getter (accessor) and setter (mutator) method to modify the instance variable. 
The most important component of this class is the toString() method which, when invoked, returns a String 
indicating the number of sides in the polygon.



Assignement 3:
Review String methods in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
1. Explain valueOf methods in String class.
2. How many replace methods are defined in String class. Explain what the replace methods do with comprehensive examples. Explain how the string's immutable property 
is preserved inspite of the fact that replace methods modifies string.
3. Explain how compareTo method works? Explain how the lexiographic ordering works with code samples.
4. Which methods can be used to convert case of the characters in string?
5. How many indexOf methods are defined in String class. Expalin how these methods work with comprehensive examples
    Note: include lasIndexOf methods in your analysis 
6. How many substring methods are defined in String class. Explain how these methods work with comprehensive examples.

Assignment 4: 

Using only length and substring methods of the String class, write a program to take input from console and print reverse of the string.
e.g:
    input: Hello
    output:
        Hellow reversed is olleH


Assignment 5:

Write a program to check if an input string is palindrome 
Note: Palindrom is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run
e.g:
    input: Madam
    outout:
        Madam is a palindrom
    input: Test
    output:
        Test is not a palindrome.

Assignment 6:
Write a while loop that replaces every occurrence of “cat” in the message with “dog” using the indexOf and substring methods.

public class ChallengeReplace
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
     String message = "I love cats! I have a cat named Coco. My cat's very smart!";

     // Write a loop here that replaces every occurrence of "cat"
     // in the message with "dog", using indexOf and substring.



     System.out.println(message);
   }
}
