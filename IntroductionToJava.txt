12. Java Basics
A Java package is group of related libraries.
An author of a java library can choose to create a java library that includes unrelated java classes in a library
Creating libraries leads to "modular" programming
Creating packages leads to "modular" programming
java.lang package is automatically imported in every java program.
You can use import statement to import classes from java.lang package.
A java program must have at least one class that has main method.
A java program must have at least one class that has main method in order to run it.
A Java program may contain multiple classes and several classes may have their own main method.
javac compiles java program to java byte code that can be run by java virtual machine
To import all of the classes from a package you can use following characters.


13. Variables and identifiers

A variable stores a value and it must have a type.
Java is statically typed language.
What is the difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages?
Python is dynamically typed language.
Identifies are
  1. name of the Variable
  2. name of parameter to a function
  3. name of a method
  4. name of a class
  5. return type of a method
Identifiers can begin with a digit
Identifiers may contain space as long as they are inside double quote.
Identifiers may contain following
  $
  _
  -
  1
  @
  *
Which of the following are invalid identifier?
$seven
7seven
_seven_7$
seven_$7

14. Primitive types and String
primitive types are also called built-in types
String is a class that is defined in java.lang package
Name 8 primitive types in java.
Range if int in java is -2^16 to 2^16-1
double precision floating point number.
Integer is stored in
  1. 4 bytes
  2. 2 bytes
  3. 8 bytes
Match the following
  int - 32 bits
  short - 16 bits
  long - 64 bits
  byte - 8 bits
  char - 16 bits
  float - 32 bits
  double - 64 bits
  boolean - 1 bit
floating point numbers must be stored in double typed variables.
floating point numbers must be stored in double or float typed variables.
Any real numbers can be stored in int typed variables.
All real numbers can be assigned to double and float typed variables.
Each of the primitive types has a class has equivalent class representation in java.lang package.
Whole numbers MUST be stored in int, byte or short typed variables.
Match the following primitive types to equivalent built in Class
  int - java.lang.Integer
  short - java.lang.Short
  long - java.lang.Long
  byte - java.lang.Byte
  char - java.lang.Character
  float - java.lang.Float
  double - java.lang.Double
  boolean - java.lang.Boolean
Which ones in the following are NOT the primitive type?
  int
  boolean
  Boolean
  byte
  Double
  String
String can be enclosed by parentheses ().
Number 22 can be stored in double typed variable.

15. Declaring and casting variables.

Select valid variable declarations and/or assignments.
  int a,b,c = 2;
  int a, b, c = 2;
  boolean a;
  boolean int = false;
  boolean int = 0;

  Select the value of i after running the following code block.
      double d = 2.8;
      int i = (int) d;
    1. 2
    2. 3
    3. compile error
  Select the value of i after running the following code block.
      double d = 2.8;
      int i = Math.ceil(d);
    1. 2
    2. 3
    3. compile error

Select the value of i after running the following code block.
    double d = 2.8;
    int i = (int) Math.ceil(d);
  1. 2
  2. 3
  3. compile error

What is the value if i after running following code block
    final int i;
    i=2;
  1. 2
  2. 0
  3. code does not compile, compile error
What is the value if i after running following code block
    final int i = 1;
    i=2;
  1. 2
  2. 1
  3. code does not compile, compile error
To declare a constant, variable must be declared as final variable.
The difference between int and double is that int can be a decimal while double can't

17. Input and Output
println and print methods are both part of System.out package
What is the difference between println and print method
System.out.println() method prints new line character after printing
What are escape sequences
Import statement is required to use Scanner class
Import statement is required to use System.out.println method
Import statement may be added before using System.out.println method
System.out.println() method begins printing on a new line
Which of the following escape sequences causes String to print on a new line
  \", \\, \n, \t
