1
A(n) control statement is a statement that supports repetition and conditional execution
2
The If control structure is an iteration (repetition) control structure.
3
Would the body be executed in the following control structure?
if ( 1 < 2 )
{ // body }
4
If the condition of a if statement evaluates to be false, its body is still executed.
5
With the extended if-else statement, you can check for many different conditions.
6
The else block is only evaluated after all conditions checked for the in the if-else statement have evaluated to be false.
How many times would the body be executed for the following control structure? - 5
  for ( int i = 1; i <= 5; i++ )
    { body}
7
How many times would the body be executed for the following control structure? - 5
  int i = 3;
  while ( i <= 6 ) {
    i++;
    // body
  }
8
what is the difference between following loops
a) do {/* body */} while (condition)
b) while (condition) { /* body */ }
9
How many times would the body be executed for following control structure? - 0
int i = 4;
while (i < 4) {/*body*/}
10
How many times would the body be executed for following control structure? - 1
int i = 4;
do {/* body */ } while (i < 4)
11
What is the value of i after following switch statement? - 6
  int i=4;
  switch (i) {
  case 5:
   i++;
  case 4:
    i++;
  case 6:
    i++;
  }
12
What is the value of i after following switch statement? - 7
  int i=3;
  switch (i) {
  default:
    i++;
  case 5:
   i++;
  case 4:
    i++;
  case 6:
    i++;
  }

13
What is the value of i after following switch statement? - 5
  int i=4;
  switch (i) {
  case 5:
   i++;
  case 4:
    i++;
    break;
  case 6:
    i++;
  }
14
What is the value of i after following block of code? - 1
int i=0;
if (i++ == 1) {
  i++;
}
15
What is the value of i after following block of code? - 2
int i=0;
if (++i == 1) {
  i++;
}
15
What is the value of i after following block of code? - 2
int i,j=0;
if (i++ == 1 || j == 0) {
  i++;
}
16
Ternary operator is same as if else statement

17
Following 2 statements will produce identical values for a
a)  int a;
    if (1>2) {
      a = 1;
    } else {
      a=2;
    }
b) int a = 1>2 ? 1 : 2
18.
in the do...while statement, the body of the loop is executed at least once
19.
Refactor the following while statement using for loop.
while (true) {
  i++;
}
20.
Following for loop is valid. - compile error
for (int i;i<2;) {
  i++;
}
21

int i=0;
for (;i<2;) {
  i++;
}
22.
Following for loop is valid. - yes
int i=0;
for (;;) {
  i++;
}
23
Following for loop is valid. - yes
int i=0;
for (;true;) {
  i++;
}
24
Following for loop is valid. - compile error
int i=0;
for (;false;) {
  i++;
}
25
Following for loop is valid. - compile error
for (boolean x = true; x ; x = false) {
  System.out.println(x);
}
25
How many times does the following code print value of x - 1 time.
for (boolean x = true; x ; x = false) {
  System.out.println(x);
  x = !x;
}
26
Following for loop is valid. - compile error
int i=0;
boolean x = false;
for (;x;) {
  i++;
}
27
Following for loop is valid. - true
int i=0;
boolean x = true;
for (;x;) {
  i++;
}
28
How many times does the following code print value of x - 0 times.
for (boolean x = true; !x ;) {
  System.out.println(x);
}
