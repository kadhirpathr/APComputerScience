48.2 Access modifiers control if the variables can be accessed from outside the class
48.3 keywords are same as reserved words.
48.4 variables and methods that are defined as private can only be access by methods of that class 
48.5 private keyword is used to implement "data hiding" Object Oriented Programming priciple
48.6 static keyword can only be applied to class variables.
48.7 static variables are same as class variables.
48.8 static keyword is non-access modifier keyword
48.9 static methods and variables can be accessed without instantiating a class.
48.10 The _____ keyword is used when you want to make a class universally accessible.
48.11 main method is private
48.12 Static methods can modify instance variables. (False)
48.13 Static variable can only be accessed and modified by static methods.
48.14 static variable can be modified instance methods.
48.15 static keyword can be combined with final keyword when defining variables (e.g: static final int i = 0;)
48.16 static keyword can be combined with private keyword when defining variables (e.g: static private int i = 0;)
48.17 static keyword can be combined with final and private keyword when defining variables (e.g: private static final int i;)
48.18 static keyword can be combined with final and public keyword when defining variables (e.g: public static final int i;)
